# begginer_python_projects
A collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that explore file handling, dictionaries, loops, and basic program structure. Includes a personal notes saver, a diary app with optional PIN protection, and a to-do list manager. These projects demonstrate my early journey in learning Python and will be improved over time.
